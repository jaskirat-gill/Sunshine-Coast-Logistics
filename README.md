This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```bash
# Gmail Configuration for Contact Form
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
CONTACT_TO_EMAIL=email@email.com

# WordPress Configuration (for content)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=https://demoadmin.jaskiratgill.ca
```

**Important:** For Gmail, you need to:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an "App Password" (not your regular password)
3. Use that App Password in the `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` variable

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Contact Form

The contact form on the `/contact` page uses Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP to send emails. The form submits to `/api/contact` which handles email sending with proper validation and error handling.
